nc - On the server system, where you want to open a port and listen on it, you can issue nc -lp 1234 or better yet, nc -vnlp 1234, which is equivalent to nc -v -l -n -p 1234

NMAP
-sV version info
-sC scripts
-p- full port range
-T4 quick scan

option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Timestamp to discover live hosts
-pp
option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Address Mask to discover live hosts
-pm
option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Echo to discover life hosts
-pe


Scan Type	Example Command
ARP Scan	sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Echo Scan	sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Timestamp Scan	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
ICMP Address Mask Scan	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
TCP SYN Ping Scan	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
TCP ACK Ping Scan	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
UDP Ping Scan	sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30

Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.

Option	Purpose
-n	no DNS lookup
-R	reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
-sn	host discovery only

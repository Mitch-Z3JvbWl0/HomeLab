## High Priority (Essential Setup and Configuration)

- [x] Configure OPNsense Firewall: Set up basic security policies and NAT to protect the lab.
- [ ] Implement VLANs: Segregate traffic for different lab segments (Red Team, Blue Team, Management).
- [ ] Set Up Wazuh SIEM: Get the SIEM system running for log collection and analysis.
- [x] Install and Configure DNS/DHCP Services: Centralize network services management, typically on DC01.
- [x] Deploy Windows Server VM with Active Directory: Essential for practicing enterprise network management.
- [x] Network Connectivity Verification: Ensure all lab devices can communicate as intended.
- [x] IP Address Management: Verify no conflicts and set up DHCP server with proper scope.
- [ ] Deploy ParrotOS/Kali VM: Set up for penetration testing and security research.
- [ ] Create Metasploitable/Vulnhub VMs: Set up vulnerable machines for penetration testing practice.
- [ ] Network File Share

## Medium Priority (Security Enhancements and Monitoring)

- [ ] Install IDS/IPS: Use Snort or Suricata to monitor network for malicious activities.
- [ ] Set Up Vulnerability Scanner: Integrate OpenVAS to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Implement Backup Solution: Ensure data redundancy for critical VMs and configurations.
- [ ] Deploy Network Monitoring Tool: Use Nagios Core or Zabbix for real-time network status.
- [ ] Integrate Log Management: Incorporate Graylog or ELK Stack for advanced log management.

## Low Priority (Advanced Security Tools and Training):

- [ ] Install Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Configure TheHive Project or OSSEC for detailed monitoring and alerting.
- [ ] Web Application Security: Set up OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite Community Edition for web app testing.
- [ ] Red Team Tools: Add ParrotOS, Kali Linux, BlackArch, or ArchStrike VMs for diverse penetration testing environments.
- [ ] Set Up Web Application Firewall (WAF): Configure ModSecurity with the OWASP CRS.
- [ ] Virtual Network Simulation: Use GNS3 or EVE-NG to simulate larger network environments.

## Additional Projects (Expansion and Community):

- [ ] Install Vulnerable Systems: Get VulnHub VMs or set up DVWA for targeted practice.
- [ ] CTF Challenges: Set up CTFd to host or practice cybersecurity competitions.
- [ ] Documentation and Wiki: Start a DokuWiki or MediaWiki for documenting lab configurations and procedures.
- [ ] Team Communication: Implement Mattermost or Rocket.Chat if collaboration is needed.
- [ ] Physical Lab Security: Ensure the physical security of lab equipment.
- [ ] Migrate Hosting: Migrate the hosting environment to new hardware and proxmox hyper visor
